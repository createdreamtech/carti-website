## What's missing that we're working on adding?
- We could use a break down of all the permutations of commands
- A developer overview of the components of carti-core
- An explanation of the restrictions around config
- An explanation of how to apply json-schema restrictions to config
- More tutorials that show how to add all the drives and load them with Descartes
- Are we still missing things ? Just create a github issue we'll add them to our docs!
